About the code

File with R code "Analysis.R" does the following steps

Merging the training and the test data sets 
Read files
Read train dataset
Read test dataset
Read features
Read activity labels
Assign column names
Merge all data in one set
Subsetting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Read column names from features with ID
Make subset of all measurements
Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
Creating a second, independent clean data set with the mean of the subset parameters for each activity and each subject
Make second tidy data set 
Write second tidy data set in txt file
About variables:

xTrain, yTrain, xTest, yTest, subjectTrain and subjectTest contain the data from the downloaded files.
xFull, yFull and subjectFull contain the merged datasets for further analysis.
features contain the parameter names for the xFull dataset (subset to xFull_msd only for the mean and  srd. deviation)
activities contain the activity labels which is then assigned to the yFull dataframe
Merged contains the combined columns of xFull_msd, yFull and subjectFull
